# MLflow.js

A JavaScript library designed to provide seamless integration with MLflow's REST API. This package offers access to all the essential endpoints for both the MLflow Tracking Server and Model Registry, along with high-level abstraction workflows, enabling efficient management of machine learning experiments and model lifecycle.

# Install

```bash
npm install mlflow-js
```

# Usage

An example of how to create an experiment:

```javascript
import Mlflow from 'mlflow-js';

// Initialize the MLflow client
const mlflow = new Mlflow(process.env.MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI);

// Create a new experiment
async function createExperiment() {
  await mlflow.createExperiment('My Experiment');
  console.log('Experiment created successfully');
}

createExperiment();
```
